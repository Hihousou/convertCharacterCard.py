# convertCharacterCard.py
Just a simple function that converts character cards of the v2 specification to a dictionary since I couldn't find any online.

I don't believe this will work with other card types, I haven't tested since I don't use anything else.

### How to use:
1. Install the dependencies found in `requirements.txt`
2. Paste the contents of `convertCharacterCard.py` somewhere in your script.
3. Run the `function` with the `filePath` to the character card and voila.
   ```python
   characterData = convertCharacterCard("FILE_PATH_HERE")
   ```
